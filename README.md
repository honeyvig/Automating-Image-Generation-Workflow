# Automating-Image-Generation-Workflow
r to leverage AI tools, such as Automatic1111, Comfy Ui stable diffusion, Midjourney, Leonardo AI, Fooocus and more to create realistic images of models wearing our clothing line. This project will involve using provided fabric images to generate visually appealing representations that showcase our designs effectively.

Responsibilities:

Utilize AI software to create multiple realistic images of models wearing our clothing.
Incorporate provided fabric images to accurately reflect the textures and patterns of our designs.
Ensure that the final images highlight the clothing's fit, style, and overall aesthetic.
Deliver high-quality images suitable for marketing and promotional use.
Requirements:

Experience with AI image generation tools.
Strong portfolio demonstrating previous work in fashion or clothing representation.
Ability to work independently and meet deadlines.
Excellent communication skills for feedback and revisions.
To Apply: Please submit your portfolio and a brief description of your experience with AI image creation. Include any relevant projects that showcase your ability to create realistic and stylish images.
=====================
Python script that outlines an automated workflow for generating realistic images of models wearing specific clothing designs using AI tools such as Stable Diffusion (Automatic1111 and Comfy UI). This script assumes you have the required AI tools installed and configured.
Python Code for Automating Image Generation Workflow
Install Required Libraries

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

    Automatic1111 (Stable Diffusion web UI)
    ComfyUI or other tools for advanced configurations

Install Python libraries needed for preprocessing and integration:

pip install pillow requests openai

Python Script

import os
import requests
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

# Configuration
STABLE_DIFFUSION_API_URL = "http://localhost:7860"  # Replace with your Stable Diffusion API URL
OUTPUT_DIR = "./generated_images"
FABRIC_IMAGES_DIR = "./fabric_images"

# Ensure output directory exists
os.makedirs(OUTPUT_DIR, exist_ok=True)

# Function to preprocess fabric images (e.g., resizing or pattern extraction)
def preprocess_fabric_image(fabric_path):
    with Image.open(fabric_path) as img:
        img = img.resize((512, 512))  # Resize to match model input requirements
        return img

# Function to generate an image using Stable Diffusion API
def generate_image(prompt, fabric_image_path):
    fabric_image = preprocess_fabric_image(fabric_image_path)
    fabric_bytes = BytesIO()
    fabric_image.save(fabric_bytes, format="PNG")
    fabric_bytes.seek(0)

    # Stable Diffusion API payload
    payload = {
        "prompt": prompt,
        "negative_prompt": "blurry, unrealistic",
        "steps": 50,
        "cfg_scale": 7.5,
        "sampler_index": "Euler a"
    }

    # Request to Stable Diffusion API
    response = requests.post(
        url=f"{STABLE_DIFFUSION_API_URL}/sdapi/v1/img2img",
        files={"init_image": ("fabric.png", fabric_bytes)},
        data=payload
    )
    if response.status_code == 200:
        result = response.json()
        image_data = BytesIO(result["images"][0].encode("latin1"))
        generated_image = Image.open(image_data)
        return generated_image
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Error: {response.text}")

# Generate images for a list of fabric images
def generate_clothing_images():
    fabric_images = [os.path.join(FABRIC_IMAGES_DIR, f) for f in os.listdir(FABRIC_IMAGES_DIR)]
    for fabric_image_path in fabric_images:
        prompt = "A fashion model wearing a modern outfit made of [fabric_pattern]."
        prompt = prompt.replace("[fabric_pattern]", os.path.basename(fabric_image_path).split(".")[0])

            print(f"Generating image for {fabric_image_path}...")

            print(f"Image saved: {output_path}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error generating image for {fabric_image_path}: {e}")

How It Works

    Fabric Images:
        Store fabric images in a directory (FABRIC_IMAGES_DIR).
        The script will preprocess each image (resize it to match Stable Diffusion requirements).

    Prompt Engineering:
        Prompts are dynamically generated based on the fabric file name. You can customize prompts for specific styles or patterns.

    Stable Diffusion API:
        The script sends a request to the API, including fabric patterns and the desired prompt.
        Uses the img2img endpoint to blend fabric designs into realistic models.

    Image Generation:
        Generated images are saved in the OUTPUT_DIR directory, with file names indicating the corresponding fabric.

Requirements for Execution

    A local installation of Automatic1111 or equivalent Stable Diffusion tool.
    A directory of fabric images representing the textures or patterns.
    Ensure the Stable Diffusion API server is running.

Portfolio Application

Use this tool to:

    Generate sample images for your portfolio.
    Demonstrate versatility by including various styles, patterns, and prompts.
    Optimize prompts for specific customer requirements (e.g., casual, formal, or cultural attire).
